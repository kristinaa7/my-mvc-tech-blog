My Model View Controller Tech Blog

## Description
In this activity, I created a Content Management System (CMS) style blog site where developers are able to create their own blog posts and comment on other developers' posts.

## Installation 


## Usage
To begin using, you must first update the .env (environment file) and update it with your username and password for MYSQL.

Make sure to save your changes and run the following commands to create the database, input the seed data, and run the server.

`mysql -u root -p` <br>
`<yourpassword>` <br>
`source db/schema.sql;` <br>
`exit` <br>
`npm run seed` <br>
`npm run start` <br>
